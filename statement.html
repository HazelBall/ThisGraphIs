            <h1>What is this?</h1>
            <p>ThisGraphIs is a representation of the creation, interpretation, and reaction to data that we experience daily. It is an interactive art project, where anyone viewing can alter and create parts of the data used for the website and the graphs shown. After helping create new data within the artwork, the response of the user is taken into the artwork through the form of emoji reaction buttons. Once the user reacts to a graph, they can see the general consensus of each reaction from past users.</p>
            <p>The project was created using Javascript, HTML, and CSS hosted on GitHub pages. The website is minimally styles to represent the emotionless perception of dataâ€™s meaning. The website interacts with a FireBase Firestore database to upload and interact with graph data and production. Users can click a button to find new graphs from the database to react to, but can also choose to create their own, where they may input a title and y Axis label. The website then generates randomized data and shows the new graph to the user to react to, and uploads it to the database upon the first reaction.</p>
            <h1>Why does it Exist?</h1>
            <p>With this piece, I wanted to explore the themes of data creation and visualization and how manipulated/generated data can affect our lives. Graphs are an integral way to visualize sets of data easily. However, they are very easy to manipulate in order to convey a malformed representation of the real world. When creating graphs for data, especially when it pertains to real aspects of human life, it is important to remain unbiased and to take note of possible skews within the data that pushes an agenda of some sort. With this project, there is no way to push an agenda as the graph is randomly generated. You can add a title and axis label that you believe will create a meaningful graph, only for the website to create something so surreal, wrong, or malformed that the agenda that existed no longer has any significance.</p>
            <h1>Who made it?</h1>
            <p>My name is Hunter Ball. I am a sophomore at the University of Arizona. I made this for my ISTA 301 final project. I am a Computer Science B.A. major. I am very interested in the way we interact with technology and the effects it has. The ideas of digital consumption, digital minimalism, and social media and interactivity are fascinating. This piece was built to help understand some of these topics.</p>
